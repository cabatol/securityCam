Security Camera Code
Link Github: https://github.com/CSUMB-SP17-CST205/Project02-Team33.git

Description: Code uses camera to judge whether there is movement in the room.
              If there is movement in the room the code will send an email to
              the user with a recording of the movement captured. The camera will
              stay on, monitoring for movement until prompted to close by the user.#
 
What we planned on achieveing for this project was to have a stationary security camera but it would 
only start recording if more than 25% of the pixels have changed. It would also need to recognize an authorized
face and if it did not recognize then it should also start recording and save the file. After the footage has been 
saved then save the file via SMS or email to the user saying that there is an intruder.
The envision for this project was to basically have an advanced security system in a home. With more time we could have
added better features such as voice recognition and fingerprinting.
